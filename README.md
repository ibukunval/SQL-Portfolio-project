OUR WORLD IN DATA- COVID 19 (KAGGLE)

Project Description:
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It began in Wuhan, China on December 8, 2019 and was declared in January 30, 2020 by The World Health Organization (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. The virus can be transmitted via droplets from an infected person’s mouth or nose when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Individuals with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer and older people are more likely to develop serious illness.
What better way to influence the world? What better way to picture large global problems? How can powerful changes be made to reshape our world? These questions are what inspires OWID.
OWID believes that important knowledge is often stored in inaccessible databases and they are passionately driven to utilize existing research and data to achieve progress. Hence, to gain knowledge and attain progress, OWID took to collecting data on the 2019 pandemic. 
The dataset contains 67 columns and over 200,000 rows with records from January, 2020 to September, 2022. The dataset is still been updated on a daily basis.

The problem:
Considering the available data, certain questions are to be answered, such as?
•	How many persons were infected with the virus (nationally and globally)?
•	What was the total number of deaths during the record period?
•	How many persons received at least one approved vaccine?
•	How much did the virus affect the six (6) different continent?

The Design
Microsoft Excel was used to divide the dataset into two different tables so as to remove redundant data and improve the integrity of data. 
Microsoft SQL Server was used to carry out several queries on the dataset for the purpose of gaining insights on the impact of COVID 19 in different parts of the world.

FINDINGS
This shows that:
a)	Review period was from 1st January, 2020 to 30th September, 2022.
b)	There were a total of 615952344 COVID 19 cases with a total of 6507144 deaths as a result of the pandemic during the period of review.
c)	Dataset contained several variables (vaccinations, population, chronic disease conditions, etc) that may be linked to severity of COVID 19
d)	Total number of persons vaccinated at least once against the virus was 24,741,000
e)	Total number of countries captured during the review period was 244.
The first record of COVID 19 captured in the data was on 23rd January, 2020. North Korea had the highest cases of COVID 19 deaths. Sudan recorded the highest deaths percentage in March, 2020. North America had the highest number of deaths. Europe had the highest percentage of persons with COVID. North America recorded the highest number of deaths. Europe ranked third as par likelihood of dying due to COVID. 

Conclusion:
There was an increasing number of persons infected with the COVID 19 virus as the year progressed. This may be due to the availability of test kits required to carry out diagnosis of the ailment. In Africa, Seychelles had the highest percentage number of persons infected with COVID for 261 days consecutively in March, 2022. A total of 50913 records related to COVID 19 was obtained from Africa during the period.
